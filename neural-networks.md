## Concepts
* `Neural network` - systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains
    * Consist of `nodes` (neurons) connected to each other via `edges` (synapses) 
    * Each node/edge has `weight` that increases/decreases strength of signal
    * Each node takes multiple numbers as input (`signal`) and produces single number as output (via `Activation function`)
    * Nodes aggregated into `layers` (different layers perform different transformations). Typical layers: input - hidden - output
    * Networks `learn` by processing examples, making guesses and adjusting weights
* `Tensor` - multi-dimensional array of numbers
* `Hyperparameter` - parameters to control learning process (Hidden layers, Activation functions, Dropout, Learning rate)

## Types
* `GAN` (Generative Adversarial Network) - 
* `Deep learning` - multiple layers in the network to progressively extract higher-level features (edges => nose, eyes => face)
    * `CNN` (Convolutional NN) - inspired by animal visual cortex. Each neuron in one layer connected to all neurons in the next layer
        * Usage - recognition, classification, recommendation, language processing
    * `RNN` (Recurrent  NN) - connections between nodes form a directed graph along a temporal sequence
        * Usage - modeling sequence data (time series, natural language..)
    * `DBN` (Deep Belief Network) - each layer acts as a feature detector
        * Usage - generation, recognition
* `Autoencoder` - encodes data by ignoring noise; reconstructs original data from encoded one
        
## Misc
* `Deepfake` - media in which a person replaced with someone else
* 
* 

## Apps
#### Images
* `Artbreeder` - combine/edit images
* `Quick, Draw!` - recognizes doodle that you drew
* `TLDR This` - text summary
* 
* 
* 
* `GauGAN` - you draw shapes, it generates images (landscapes)
* `Nvidia image inpainting` - choose parts of image for AI to retouch
