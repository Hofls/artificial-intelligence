* Train and save model
    *
* 
* Load and use model
    * Copy saved model from `train-model/` to `use-trained-model/trained_model` 
    * Save random images of dogs and cats from the internet to `use-trained-model/test_images`
    * Run `use_trained_model.py`
    * Model should identify all `.jpg` images in `test_images` folder
